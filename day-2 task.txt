1.Write a blog on differance between document and window object

*DOCUMENT OBJECT

   The Document Object is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
   It allows developers to interact with the content and structure of a webpage through a tree-like structure called the Document Object Model (DOM). 
   By manipulating the DOM, developers can dynamically update the content and appearance of a webpage without having to reload it.
   The Document Object is part of the Window Object, which represents the current browsing context or tab in a web browser.
   
*WINDOW OBJECT

   A window object in web development refers to a browser window or tab that displays a webpage.
   It is created when a user opens a webpage and contains properties and methods that can be used to interact with the browser and the webpage.
   Developers can manipulate the properties and methods of the window object using JavaScript to control the behavior and appearance of the webpage.
